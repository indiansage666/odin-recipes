    <h2>Decription:</h2>
    <p>
      Soup favorites, chunky chili and cheesy-smooth potato soup, balance each
      other in this marriage of spicy and mild.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pounds baking potatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</li>
      <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</li>
      <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preperation Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a
        fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large
        saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up lumps, until meat
        is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan.
        Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, at least 10
        minutes to let flavors meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato
        pulp into large bowl. (You should have about 4 cups pulp). Discard
        skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in
        flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a light roux, about 2
        minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking
        constantly, until lightly thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk,
        salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, 3 to
        5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir
        in 1 cup cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
